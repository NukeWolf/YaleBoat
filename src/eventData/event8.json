We seek to understand life at a mechanistic level by studying how the extraordinarily complex molecules found in living organisms create structures, carry out chemistry, and store and utilize information to generate the remarkable properties of living organisms. Biochemistry and biophysics are rapidly advancing areas of science that underlie the current dramatic progress in medicine. &nbsp;<br><br>Our undergraduate degree programs are well suited for students planning to attend medical school or graduate studies in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, genomics, or biophysics. The MB&amp;B major differs from the programs offered by the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) department in that MB&amp;B places its central focus on studying biology using the tools of chemistry, physics, and biochemistry. MB&amp;B students thus carry out more in-depth coursework in these areas, and typically take less coursework in other areas such as organismal biology, cell biology, and genetics.<br><br>MB&amp;B has found that undergraduates have a lot of questions about what is involved in pursuing the MB&amp;B major. &nbsp;To address this, we have put together some “quick facts” about MB&amp;B. &nbsp; The intent is to answer some commonly asked questions and provide central features each potential major will want to know. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://mbb.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/2019%20Quick%20Facts%20about%20Majoring%20in%20Molecular%20Biophysics.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MBB Quick Facts</a><br><br><a href=\"https://yale.zoom.us/j/94994347640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://yale.zoom.us/j/94994347640</a>","locationText":"https://yale.zoom.us/j/94994347640","reminderEmail":"","registrationMode":"internal","confirmationEmail":"","attendeeListOption":"none","numberOfRegistrations":"Unlimited","numberOfRegistrationsswitch":true},"approved":true,"group":null,"isActive":true,"source":"in-person","createdAt":"2021-04-09T23:19:33.000Z","deletedAt":null,"registrationLimitObj":{"canRegisterEvent":true,"registrationLeft":-1,"message":"registrationLeft"},"attendeeCount":"16","attendees":null,"startDate":"2021-04-22T15:00:00-04:00","endDate":"2021-05-22T16:00:00-04:00","timeStamp":1619118000000},{"id":12913,"owner":{"id":11418808,"firstName":"Jill","lastName":"Carrera","headline":"Admissions Officer","location":"New Haven, CT, USA","identifier":"jillcarrera2","photoUrl":"https://fsm-public-files.pg.services/UXh7YgUWSKGjZ6wCN7FX"},"hub":1020,"cluster":570,"eventType":{"hub":1020,"group":null,"name":"Academic Departments & Programs","slug":"academic-departments-and-programs","description":"Get to know more about some academic departments & programs at Yale through these live events.","id":2558,"eventData":{"users":[],"userTypes":["campuscontact"],"registrationQuestions":[],"autoAcceptRegistrations":true},"isDeleted":false,"createdAt":"2021-04-07T17:37:14.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-07T17:37:14.000Z"},"eventData":{"endDate":"2021-04-22T17:00:00-04:00","headline":"German Studies","isPublic":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","startDate":"2021-04-22T16:00:00-04:00","userTypes":["campuscontact","acceptedstudent","mascotambassador","prospectivestudent","withdrawn_/_notaccepted"],"coverPhoto":"https://d1ctk4ronrg3qz.cloudfront.net/event-photos%2FF1gDAJYcTpuQ2LCNV02x_thumb_img_8750_1024_32.jpg","description":"While emphasizing the practice and theory of reading and interpretation with a rigorous study of canonical, and also non-canonical, works of German literature, the department also encompasses and encourages within its own framework the intensive study of interdisciplinary fields such as critical theory and philosophy, comparative approaches to literature, the histories of science and law, social and political thought.
