We supply what American higher education lacks: vital, constructive programming that is critical to the intellectual and professional development of a new generation of American leaders. With the world more chaotic and dangerous today than it has been in a half-century, we seed the ground for the future of American foreign policy.<br><br>Grounded in a strong and growing national foundation of student-led campus chapters, our network is central to the revitalization of our foreign policy. It acts as a bridge for our student leaders to promising internships, graduate programs, and professional opportunities in the worlds of academia, business, finance, policymaking, politics, and journalism. Our robust professional chapters in New York and Washington are convening vehicles for our members to meet like-minded peers and hear from our thought and political leaders, and our distinguished board of advisors assists us in maintaining the integrity of our programs. While our focus is on the long term, our alumni have already achieved significant influence in their professional pursuits, building the bench of talented people looking to serve the country over the course of their lives and careers. &nbsp;<br><br>Join our Info Session for the Alexander Hamilton Society!","locationText":"https://yale.zoom.us/j/98211127347","reminderEmail":"","registrationMode":"internal","confirmationEmail":"","attendeeListOption":"none","numberOfRegistrations":"Unlimited","numberOfRegistrationsswitch":true},"approved":true,"group":null,"isActive":true,"source":"in-person","createdAt":"2021-04-02T20:22:46.000Z","deletedAt":null,"registrationLimitObj":{"canRegisterEvent":true,"registrationLeft":-1,"message":"registrationLeft"},"attendeeCount":"9","attendees":null,"startDate":"2021-04-16T19:00:00-04:00","endDate":"2021-04-16T20:00:00-04:00","timeStamp":1618614000000},{"id":12585,"owner":{"id":17119147,"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Echenique","headline":"Admissions Officer","location":"New Haven, CT","identifier":"carolinaechenique","photoUrl":"https://fsm-public-files.pg.services/u8xGQWKrRE6xHCI7Kdig"},"hub":1020,"cluster":570,"eventType":{"hub":1020,"group":null,"name":"Student Groups","slug":"student-groups","description":"Opportunities to get to know student groups and resources on campus!","id":2537,"eventData":{"users":[],"userTypes":["campuscontact"],"registrationQuestions":[],"autoAcceptRegistrations":true},"isDeleted":false,"createdAt":"2021-03-31T16:01:31.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-03-31T16:01:31.000Z"},"eventData":{"endDate":"2021-04-16T20:00:00-04:00","headline":"Yale Shakespeare Club","isHidden":false,"isPublic":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","startDate":"2021-04-16T19:00:00-04:00","userTypes":["campuscontact","acceptedstudent","mascotambassador","prospectivestudent","withdrawn_/_notaccepted"],"coverPhoto":"https://d1ctk4ronrg3qz.cloudfront.net/event-photos%2FoxGfMOwATODK8brByWam_StudentGroupEvents_image.png","description":"The Yale Shakespeare Club seeks to foster a love of Shakespeare’s works.
