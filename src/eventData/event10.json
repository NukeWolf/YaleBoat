Saltzman’s research is motivated by the desire to create safer and more effective medical and surgical therapy. He focuses on tissue engineering and on creating better methods for drug delivery. His group has developed technology based on the use of bio-compatible polymeric materials for the controlled delivery of drugs, proteins, and genes. They have also developed new polymeric materials that influence the growth and assembly of tissues. Professor Saltzman received the Distinguished Lecturer Award from the Biomedical Engineering Society in 2004 and Yale’s Sheffield Teaching Prize in 2009.

Unlike those at tech schools, our students take their non-engineering subjects in classes taught by renowned faculty and together with liberal arts majors whose focus is on social, political, economic, and other humanities areas. Our engineering students grow in the understanding of the complex social, political, economic and environmental implications of new technological products and processes. They also learn to communicate effectively. Not surprisingly, many of our graduates go on to establish outstanding records of achievement not only in technical fields but also in academia, business, government, and as leaders in their community.<br><br>Like any other outstanding college engineering program, Yale teaches students the principles of math and science, modern software tools, and how to design devices and systems. With most of our faculty being involved in cutting-edge research, many opportunities exist for students to participate. A student may begin research at any time, depending on her/his preparation and the nature of the research. Many students begin as early as the summer after the freshman year.<br><br>Yale Engineering students receive ample individual attention from their professors. Yale’s School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science has approximately 100 professors and we graduate approximately 200 students each year. It's a nice ratio of graduates to faculty. Our students have the opportunity to work alongside their faculty mentors on the cutting-edge of contemporary research. Many faculty members involve undergraduates in their research. Many students make innovative contributions, and become first authors on publications.<br><br>Learn more about engineering at Yale from Vince Wilczynski and some current Yalies!<br><br>A zoom link for
