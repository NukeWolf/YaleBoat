She joined Yale in 2013 as an asssitant professor. Prior to that, she was an independent research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Software systems in Germany. Ruzica received her PhD at EPFL in 2011 and her thesis received the Patrick Denantes Prize. Starting July 2019, she was named the Donna L. Dubinsky Associate Professor of Computer Science.
