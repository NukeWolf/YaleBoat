She joined Yale in 2013 as an asssitant professor. Prior to that, she was an independent research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Software systems in Germany. Ruzica received her PhD at EPFL in 2011 and her thesis received the Patrick Denantes Prize. Starting July 2019, she was named the Donna L. Dubinsky Associate Professor of Computer Science. Professor Piskac's research interests span the areas of programming languages, software verification, automated reasoning, and code synthesis. A common thread in Ruzica's research is improving software reliability and trustworthiness using formal techniques. She has received recognitions for research and teaching, including a CACM Research Highlight, an NSF CAREER award, the Facebook Communications and Networking award, the Microsoft Research Award for the Software Engineering Innovation Foundation (SEIF), and the 2019 Ackerman Award for Teaching and Mentoring.<br><br>A zoom link for this event will be posted an hour prior to the start time.","locationText":"A zoom link for this event will be posted an hour prior to the start time.","reminderEmail":"","registrationMode":"internal","confirmationEmail":"","attendeeListOption":"none","numberOfRegistrations":"Unlimited","numberOfRegistrationsswitch":true},"approved":true,"group":null,"isActive":true,"source":"in-person","createdAt":"2021-03-30T15:53:35.000Z","deletedAt":null,"registrationLimitObj":{"canRegisterEvent":true,"registrationLeft":-1,"message":"registrationLeft"},"attendeeCount":"28","attendees":null,"startDate":"2021-04-28T10:00:00-04:00","endDate":"2021-04-28T11:00:00-04:00","timeStamp":1619618400000,"isBookmarked":false},{"id":12403,"owner":{"id":11418808,"firstName":"Jill","lastName":"Carrera","headline":"Admissions Officer","location":"New Haven, CT, USA","identifier":"jillcarrera2","photoUrl":"https://fsm-public-files.pg.services/UXh7YgUWSKGjZ6wCN7FX"},"hub":1020,"cluster":570,"eventType":{"hub":1020,"group":null,"name":"Master Classes","slug":"master-class","description":"An opportunity to learn and experience a class from one of Yale's notable professors.","id":2292,"eventData":{"users":[],"userTypes":["Friends of Michigan"],"registrationQuestions":[],"autoAcceptRegistrations":true},"isDeleted":false,"createdAt":"2020-12-22T20:02:04.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-22T20:03:32.000Z"},"eventData":{"endDate":"2021-04-28T14:00:00-04:00","headline":"Biomed Engineering of Delivery Systems for Treating Cancer","isHidden":false,"isPublic":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","startDate":"2021-04-28T12:00:00-04:00","userTypes":["campuscontact","acceptedstudent","mascotambassador","prospectivestudent","withdrawn_/_notaccepted"],"coverPhoto":"https://d1ctk4ronrg3qz.cloudfront.net/event-photos%2FGayQg9YSdaOxRyYiauiQ_maxresdefault.jpg","description":"Mark Saltzman is the Goizueta Foundation Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Chemical &amp; Environmental Engineering, &amp; Physiology. Saltzman’s research is motivated by the desire to create safer and more effective medical and surgical therapy. He focuses on tissue engineering and on creating better methods for drug delivery. His group has developed technology based on the use of bio-compatible polymeric materials for the controlled delivery of drugs, proteins, and genes. They have also developed new polymeric materials that influence the growth and assembly of tissues. Professor Saltzman received the Distinguished Lecturer Award from the Biomedical Engineering Society in 2004 and Yale’s Sheffield Teaching Prize in 2009. He currently serves as the Head of Jonathan Edwards College.<br><br>A zoom link for this event will be posted an hour prior to the start time.","locationText":"A zoom link for this event will be posted an hour prior to the start time.","reminderEmail":"","registrationMode":"internal","confirmationEmail":"","attendeeListOption":"none","numberOfRegistrations":"Unlimited","numberOfRegistrationsswitch":true},"approved":true,"group":null,"isActive":true,"source":"in-person","createdAt":"2021-03-30T15:56:45.000Z","deletedAt":null,"registrationLimitObj":{"canRegisterEvent":true,"registrationLeft":-1,"message":"registrationLeft"},"attendeeCount":"42","attendees":null,"startDate":"2021-04-28T12:00:00-04:00","endDate":"2021-04-28T14:00:00-04:00","timeStamp":1619625600000,"isBookmarked":false},{"id":12557,"owner":{"id":11418808,"firstName":"Jill","lastName":"Carrera","headline":"Admissions Officer","location":"New Haven, CT, USA","identifier":"jillcarrera2","photoUrl":"https://fsm-public-files.pg.services/UXh7YgUWSKGjZ6wCN7FX"},"hub":1020,"cluster":570,"eventType":{"hub":1020,"group":null,"name":"Cultural Centers","slug":"cultural-centers","description":"These events are created in coordination with the cultural centers and student groups that operate within them.","id":2539,"eventData":{"users":[],"userTypes":["campuscontact"],"registrationQuestions":[],"autoAcceptRegistrations":true},"isDeleted":false,"createdAt":"2021-04-01T18:15:57.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-01T18:15:57.000Z"},"eventData":{"endDate":"2021-04-28T21:00:00-04:00","headline":"La Casa es su casa: A Virtual Historical Tour","isHidden":false,"isPublic":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","startDate":"2021-04-28T20:00:00-04:00","userTypes":["campuscontact","acceptedstudent","mascotambassador","prospectivestudent","withdrawn_/_notaccepted"],"coverPhoto":"https://d1ctk4ronrg3qz.cloudfront.net/event-photos%2FH5NjWkVT9WZICORBYoqk_La%20Casa%20Logo-200x200%20(1).png","description":"Before we proceed with our futures, we’d like to be present with you in revisiting and honoring our past. Join our student staff to learn about La Casa’s origins, including our history of student activism and engagement. We are excited to have celebrated two major milestones recently! MEChA and Despierta Boricua, two of our founding student organizations, celebrated 50 years on campus in 2019 and 2021 respectively. You can get a preview of La Casa’s history on our website, this presentation will expand on that information.
