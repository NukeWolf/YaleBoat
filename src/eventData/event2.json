Since, OTYC has expanded and grown.<br><br>OTYC is entirely student-run, and designed to provide undergraduates at Yale College with opportunities to choose repertoire, produce, direct, design, and perform. Our members are singers, instrumentalists, conductors, theatre technicians, costume and set designers, choreographers, and dancers. OTYC is governed by a board of students who have varying backgrounds and experiences, but who are committed to making opera fun and accessible to everyone.<br><br>Our seasons reflect our growing organization. We perform around four operas each academic year, three of which are accompanied by an orchestra with full set and costume.
