Great! Show off your skills while playing alongside YPMB members who are also in other groups, like the Yale Concert Band and the Symphony Orchestra. Always wanted to learn how to play one? Awesome! We can hook you up with an instrument and a teacher. Love appreciating music, but not playing it? Incredible! All of our music is student arranged (that's right-we get to play all the pop, rock, hip-hop, etc. music we want!)! Love the vibe of the band, but looking for a virtual art outlet? Join the Squids, who put together all of our props for halftime shows (re: our 40ft bald eagle prop). Got a good sense of humor? Help write and put together our halftime shows-every member of the band has input!<br><br>We could go on for pages trying to tell you what we are. You’d be best off to show up and find out, really. You won’t be disappointed!<br><br>Join the Yale Precision Marching Band's Head Student Arrangers to learn how every song we play is arranged by our members! They will be teaching people tricks, tips, and advice for how to turn your favorite songs into future YPMB classics, and answering any and all questions about the arranging process.","locationText":"https://yale.zoom.us/j/3132292612","reminderEmail":"","registrationMode":"internal","confirmationEmail":"","attendeeListOption":"none","numberOfRegistrations":"Unlimited","numberOfRegistrationsswitch":true},"approved":true,"group":null,"isActive":true,"source":"in-person","createdAt":"2021-04-05T13:53:49.000Z","deletedAt":null,"registrationLimitObj":{"canRegisterEvent":true,"registrationLeft":-1,"message":"registrationLeft"},"attendeeCount":"5","attendees":null,"startDate":"2021-04-09T20:00:00-04:00","endDate":"2021-04-09T21:00:00-04:00","timeStamp":1618012800000,"isBookmarked":false},{"id":12518,"owner":{"id":17119147,"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Echenique","headline":"Admissions Officer","location":"New Haven, CT","identifier":"carolinaechenique","photoUrl":"https://fsm-public-files.pg.services/u8xGQWKrRE6xHCI7Kdig"},"hub":1020,"cluster":570,"eventType":{"hub":1020,"group":null,"name":"Student Groups","slug":"student-groups","description":"Opportunities to get to know student groups and resources on campus!","id":2537,"eventData":{"users":[],"userTypes":["campuscontact"],"registrationQuestions":[],"autoAcceptRegistrations":true},"isDeleted":false,"createdAt":"2021-03-31T16:01:31.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-03-31T16:01:31.000Z"},"eventData":{"endDate":"2021-04-09T22:00:00-04:00","headline":"Yale Mixed Martial Arts Club","isHidden":false,"isPublic":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","startDate":"2021-04-09T21:00:00-04:00","userTypes":["campuscontact","acceptedstudent","mascotambassador","prospectivestudent","withdrawn_/_notaccepted"],"coverPhoto":"https://d1ctk4ronrg3qz.cloudfront.net/event-photos%2FVBIfxhFbQtJ5rCC7rniQ_StudentGroupEvents_image.png","description":"We are the Yale Mixed Martial Arts Club.
