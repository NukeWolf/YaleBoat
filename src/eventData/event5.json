Our student-run magazine is published twice a semester and features groundbreaking scientific research at Yale and beyond. Composed of writers, editors, photographers, artists, designers, and businesspeople, our interdisciplinary team is united by the belief that science should be accessible and exciting to everyone—even those without a scientific background. This is exemplified not only in our magazine but in our outreach through Synapse, which hosts STEM outreach programs to empower New Haven elementary through high schoolers. We hope you join our team of more than 100 students and over 2,000 worldwide subscribers as we share the stories of science.<br><br>Come hang out with Yale Scientific Magazine! At this low-key event, we’ll provide a space for you to chat with masthead members, get to know your fellow prefrosh, and play different science-related games and activities (potential options include: a niche powerpoint presentation competition? a science poetry writing session?). In the meantime, learn about how you can get involved with the nation’s oldest college science publication, established in 1894.","locationText":"https://yale.zoom.us/j/99898052697","reminderEmail":"","registrationMode":"internal","confirmationEmail":"","attendeeListOption":"none","numberOfRegistrations":"Unlimited","numberOfRegistrationsswitch":true},"approved":true,"group":null,"isActive":true,"source":"in-person","createdAt":"2021-04-05T14:50:09.000Z","deletedAt":null,"registrationLimitObj":{"canRegisterEvent":true,"registrationLeft":-1,"message":"registrationLeft"},"attendeeCount":"36","attendees":null,"startDate":"2021-04-16T20:00:00-04:00","endDate":"2021-04-16T21:00:00-04:00","timeStamp":1618617600000},{"id":12690,"owner":{"id":17119147,"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Echenique","headline":"Admissions Officer","location":"New Haven, CT","identifier":"carolinaechenique","photoUrl":"https://fsm-public-files.pg.services/u8xGQWKrRE6xHCI7Kdig"},"hub":1020,"cluster":570,"eventType":{"hub":1020,"group":null,"name":"Student Groups","slug":"student-groups","description":"Opportunities to get to know student groups and resources on campus!","id":2537,"eventData":{"users":[],"userTypes":["campuscontact"],"registrationQuestions":[],"autoAcceptRegistrations":true},"isDeleted":false,"createdAt":"2021-03-31T16:01:31.000Z","updatedAt":"2021-03-31T16:01:31.000Z"},"eventData":{"endDate":"2021-04-16T21:00:00-04:00","headline":"Yale Climbing Team","isHidden":false,"isPublic":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","startDate":"2021-04-16T20:00:00-04:00","userTypes":["campuscontact","acceptedstudent","mascotambassador","prospectivestudent","withdrawn_/_notaccepted"],"coverPhoto":"https://d1ctk4ronrg3qz.cloudfront.net/event-photos%2FPsxdgTt0S1S7DJLldU7E_StudentGroupEvents_image.png","description":"The Yale Climbing Team climbs weekly at a local New Haven climbing gym.
