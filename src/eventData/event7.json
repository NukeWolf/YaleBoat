In non-COVID times, each of our 200+ members commit to any number of semester-long dances that each rehearse for an hour per week. At the end of each semester, we put on a sell-out semester show featuring all ~16 dances and a handful of shorter interludes that company members can propose. Our genres range from jazz to hip-hop, from Broadway to open-style, and we're all about sharing the fun of dancing with anyone who wants to participate. Our members come in with years of experience, or none! Finally, we also host regular social events and study breaks to keep the community engaged!<br><br>We are welcoming back a Danceworks alum for &nbsp;a fun and accessible dance workshop, which will include a short Q&amp;A with current Danceworks members. All you will need is your Zoom app, and we strongly encourage anyone who is curious about dance.
